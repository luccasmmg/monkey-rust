#+TITLE: Plan to build a lexer

- Take source code(Format of string) and output the next token
- position = last character read
- read position = next character to read
- Function readchar, that reads the next char and puts into the char box
- NextToken => match chars to enum tokens, returning the token
- My plan
- Basically turn the input into a iterator
